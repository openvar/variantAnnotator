# HGVS Variant Database
Building an interactive app that validates genomic variant descriptions in the HGVS format and adds them to a database 
in a suitable format for publication. The process of generating c. and p. descriptions is automated. Note: This app 
should only be used for variants identified by DNA sequencing techniques

### Running the app
```bash
$ streamlit run app.py
```
